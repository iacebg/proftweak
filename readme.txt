If something isn't working for you - there's a decent chance it's addressed there.  If things still don't work for you - feel free to bug me.

--Important Note for Mac Users--
If you get an error "proftweak.app is damaged and can't be opened" - it's due to your Gatekeeper settings requiring apps be signed.  See http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5290 for the solution.
